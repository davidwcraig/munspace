# munspace
Utility for using rgb colors that approximate the Munsell color space in Python.

![10 sine waves in Munsell colors](munsell-color-demo.png)

This uses the **Munsell Renotation Data from:
<https://www.rit.edu/cos/colorscience/rc_munsell_renotation.php>

I have downloaded the files from there: `all.dat` `real.dat` and 
associated `.xlsx` files. I include the text from there in a description file.
