# munspace
Utility for using rgb colors that approximate the Munsell color space in Python.

![10 sine waves in Munsell colors](munsell-color-demo.png)

I was led to the RGB value used by Andrew Werth's very nice
[Virtual Munsell Color Wheel](https://www.andrewwerth.com/aboutmunsell/) and the
Javascript there.

This uses the **Munsell Renotation Data** from:
<https://www.rit.edu/cos/colorscience/rc_munsell_renotation.php>

I have downloaded the files from there: `all.dat` `real.dat` and 
associated `.xlsx` files. I include the text from there in a description file.
